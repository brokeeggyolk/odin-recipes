            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Take the hot italian sausages out of their tubings and mix it with the beef. Dice the carrot and onion.</li>
                <li>Toss meat in pot with some oil and cook while dicing onion and carrot. Once meat is browned, add the onion and carrot to the pot as well.</li>
                <li>Add in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and some beef broth while stirring until it has a nice thick consistency.</li>
                <li>Season with italian herbs and pepper. Add salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Leave the sauce to simmer on low heat. Prepare the cheese layer by mixing the ricotta, shredded parmesan and a beat egg in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Once the onion and carrot softens, start layering the lasagna. Start with a layer of sauce in the baking pan. Place three or four noodle sheets on top. Add another layer of sauce. Add a layer of the cheese mixture. You can add extra shredded cheese as well.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of lasagna noodles and repeat the above steps until you have 3 layers. On top of the final layer of noodles use the rest of your sauce and top off the layers with shredded parmesan.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375C. Cover the lasagna pan with aluminium foil and bake in oven for 45 minutes. Uncover the aluminium foil and bake for another 15 minutes. </li>
